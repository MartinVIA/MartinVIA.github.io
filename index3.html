            <h1>Sargasum Recollection at DESMI Latinamerica</h1>
            <a class="proyectimage"><img src="images/desmi.jpg"></a>
            <h2>I worked on the recollection of an algae called sargassum, it is dangerous for tourists and also generally disliked for its rotten smell.
                Due to climate change, this sargasum started appearing much more often on caribean coastlines. de Danish company, DESMI, has a division for business in Latinamerica. From that division i was assigned the monitoring of hands-on work and engineering optimizations in the plans for Sartgassum recollection.

            </h2>
            <h2>
                Also, I was asigned to perform geolocational measurements and vectorial calculations for the flow of sargassum across multiple parts of a popular Hotel's coast. It basically entailed putting balloons on some algae and measuring their movements hehe.
